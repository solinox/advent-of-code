L,12,L,10,R,8,L,12,R,8,R,10,R,12,L,12,L,10,R,8,L,12,R,8,R,10,R,12,L,10,R,12,R,8,L,10,R,12,R,8,R,8,R,10,R,12,L,12,L,10,R,8,L,12,R,8,R,10,R,12,L,10,R,12,R,8

Can be simplified to

A=L,12,L,10,R,8,L,12,R,8,R,10,R,12
B=L,10,R,12,R,8
C=R,8,R,10,R,12

A,A,B,B,C,A,B

Since A is too long, it can be rearranged such that

A=L,12,L,10,R,8,L,12
B=L,10,R,12,R,8
C=R,8,R,10,R,12

A,C,A,C,B,B,C,A,C,B
